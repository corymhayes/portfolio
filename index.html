            Made it a resolution this year, 2018, to run my first half-marathon. I had no clue about where to start
            but eventually stumbled on to Hal Higdonâ€™s half-marathon training schedule. As much as like the program I wanted to
            see if I could build something that was a little easier to read and little more visually appealing than just 
            a straight table.

        <h2>Guitar Tab Favorites</h2>
        <a href="#">http://github.com/corymhayes</a>
        <p>
            I began teaching myself to play guitar many years ago and one of the things that helped me to learn were tabs.
            As such over the years I have developed a certain catalogue of songs that I like playing and typically always
            end up right back on that same tab. So I figured why not develop a simple database and a table to display all
            my favorite tabs. Now not only are my favorite tabs in one place, its also sortable, so if I want to keep in a
            certain tuning or just feel playing songs by a certain artist, it's all one click away.

            This is currently just a mockup but eventually I would like to develop this into an app that ties into a database,
            keeping track of users, journals, and journal entries. One of the things I thought might help seperate it from other journals
            is: 1) ability to add a photo to a certain journal entry, 2) adding a tl;dr, "too long; didn't read" to top of the journal entry,
            allowing the user to add a summation to an entry for quick reference.
